# Example Single Page Application using the XcooBee Cookie Kit web

This is an example of a single page application showing the use of the XcooBee Cookie Kit (XCK).

The XCK is a framework you can plug in to manage the creation and removal of coookies on your site after user gives or removes consent.

Please see the cookie kit for detailed documentation.

## This example

The example has only one code file `index.html`. Please review the comments inside it to see how the XCK is started and managed.

Inside code, look for a tag of `<!-- COOKIE KIT SCRIPT START -->` to see the example implementation.

## The assumptions

- You are setting all cookies in JS
- You are not loading 3rd party scripts, like Google Analytics (see main documentation on example how to load a series of scripts that set cookies).
